# Network-Intrusion-Detection-with-machine-learning
Developing a system to detect network intrusions involves employing machine learning algorithms to monitor and safeguard computer networks from unauthorized access and malicious activities. The primary objective is to create a predictive model, typically a classifier, capable of effectively distinguishing between legitimate network connections (normal) and malicious ones (intrusions/attacks). This task is crucial for ensuring network security and preventing unauthorized access by both external threats and potentially malicious insiders.
